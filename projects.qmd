[ICICCS 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10142228/proceeding)

- Devised a speech-to-speech translation system with ASR, NMT, TTS, and lip-synchronization; achieved BLEU score of 85.26%
for translation, MOS of 4.56 for lip-synced video, and MOS of 4.94 for synthesized audio, enabling seamless audio-visual
alignment.\
