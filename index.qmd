# Ritu V. Malage

an AI-ML Engineer at Pronisi with over 2 years of experience in building and deploying end-to-end intelligent systems across Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Generative AI. 
I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [PES University](https://pes.edu/), where I developed a strong foundation in algorithms and applied machine learning.\
At Pronisi, I have contributed to projects ranging from real-time activity analysis and posture assessment pipelines to RAG-powered recommendation systems with LLMs, while also driving efficiency through pipeline optimization and scalable architectures.
Alongside engineering, I’ve mentored interns and introduced Agile practices to strengthen collaboration and improve sprint productivity.\
My journey extends beyond engineering into research contributions and applied innovation, with work published at various conferences, reflecting my passion for bridging advanced AI research with real-world applications.
